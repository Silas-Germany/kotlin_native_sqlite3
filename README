This is a short and easy example for kotlin native with cInterop for Sqlite3

I had a lot of troubles finding good and short examples how to do this, so I want to publish this for reference for others. Especially how to use the CPointer<*> datatype to pass an empty pointer to a method to get the resulting struct was really hard for me to figure out (as there are not enough good examples out there).

You should be able to run this with the command:
gradle runReleaseExecutableNative
If you don't have gradle installed, you should use an IDE to build it (I used Intellij IDEA).
